- this challenge is a basic integer overflow
    ```c
        if(a > 0 && b > 0 && result < 0)
        return -1;
    ```
    u just need to get the result -1
    so how we can enter a and b greater than zero and the sum of them will be less than zero how??
    we know that int data type can store the numbers in range 
    2147483647 to -2147483647
    so what if we entered a number greater than 2147483647
    think about it like a clock when u make you way from 1 to 12 after 12 it starts again
    so the int data type we know that it starts with -2147483647 and ends with 2147483647
    so if we entered the first num as 2147483647 and the second one as 1 or any positive number so the sum of them will go to the minus 
    and thats how we get our flag
