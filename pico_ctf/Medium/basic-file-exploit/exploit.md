- the challenge is pretty easy if u read the code you will find this 
    ``` c
    if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
    }
    ```
    this tells us if the entry_number is 0 the prog will print the flag
    so we just need to put it
    but to read the stack with option 2 u must enter a data to it first
    so fill a data using option 1 
    and then read the data 
    use the entry point 0 
    and boom the flag is printed
